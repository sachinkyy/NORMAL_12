# Stopwatch Application

This is a simple yet fully functional stopwatch application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It provides essential stopwatch features such as starting, pausing, resetting, and recording lap times.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and perform precise time calculations in real-time.

## Features
- Start, pause, and reset the stopwatch with button controls
- Record multiple lap times during a session
- Clear and minimal interface for easy use
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
- Accurate time tracking down to milliseconds

## How It Works
The application uses JavaScript's `setInterval()` method to update the displayed time in real-time.  
Event listeners are attached to each control button to start, pause, or reset the timer.  
Lap times are stored in an array and dynamically displayed on the page without requiring a refresh.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for logic, event handling, and time calculations

## Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you can learn:
- DOM manipulation techniques
- Event-driven programming in JavaScript
- Real-time time tracking and calculations
- Creating responsive and accessible web interfaces
